A quick bash shell script to sort through a directory full of images or video files taken on different camera phones and sort them into a specified directory structure based on the physical names of the files.

It requires that the file name contains the date the image was taken.

It currently accounts for images from my previous mobile phones

Samsung Galaxy S2 pictures and videos taken with built-in camera
Samsung Galaxy S2 pictures taken with Instagram camera
Samsung Galaxy Y pictures and videos taken with built-in camera

The script will also update the timestamp on the files so that they will show the correct timestamp in OSX Finder
